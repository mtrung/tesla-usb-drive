## How to use

### Method 1 - Recommended

Double-click on the tesla-usb-drive.command and follow instructions.

### Method 2

Use the script with parameters. This is good for automation/making multiple drives.

Syntax: `tesla-usb-drive.command USB_DISK_IDENTIFIER Cam_Partition_Size Partitioning_Scheme`

- USB_DISK_IDENTIFIER: disk1
- Cam_Partition_Size: percentage (ex: 50%) or storage size value (ex: 16g)
  - To create cam partition only, use '100%'.
  - To create music partition only, use '0%' or '0'.
  - To create both, use 1%-99% or an in-betweeen storage size value
- Partitioning_Scheme: MBR or GPT. Optional. Default is MBR.

Example: `tesla-usb-drive.command disk3 16g MBR`

## Notes

- Requires that you have admin privilege
- Will wipe out all data on your USB drive
- It creates cam partition first using the above size param then music partition using remaining storage space.
- If you download the script as text file, you need to make this script executable using below command in Terminal: `chmod +x tesla-usb-drive.command`
- macOS diskutil will add 200MB EFI partition if you choose GPT partitioning scheme for >= 4GB drive.
